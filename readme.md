### Sensirion SEN66 - new, all-in-one aq sensor from Sensirion

It combines all the most important AQ sensors into one small package!

Unfortunately, the sensor is a bit expensive and harder to get, as it is brand new.

It starts around 55€ at the moment but I am sure the price will fall next year as it happened to the predecessor (SEN5X series).

I bought mine from Digikey, but here are some more links:

https://www.tme.eu/at/details/sen66-sin-t/gassensoren/sensirion/3-001-030/

https://www.mouser.at/ProductDetail/Sensirion/SEN66-SIN-T-ES

https://www.digikey.at/en/products/detail/sensirion-ag/sen66-sin-t/25700945

As i bought some extra, i sell 2 or 3 on [ebay](https://www.ebay.at/itm/388088341147), €62 in austria shipping included, EU + shipping

## PCB
![alt text](images/pcb.png "PCB")

Gerber file to order at JLCPCP or PCBWAY or ....
[Gerber_aqMood_PCB_aqMood_seeed_c3_2025-03-14.zip](PCB/Gerber_aqMood_PCB_aqMood_seeed_c3_2025-03-14.zip)

or get it from here:

https://oshwlab.com/tobi.stanzel/aqmood

Qwiic connector is optional, as it would require SMD soldering equipment.

## Print instructions


3 files, the top can be printed in multi-color, i used 0.2 Speed settings on my XL and MK4 with PLA.

![alt text](images/print_overview.png "print overview")


### AqMood-Bottom
Print in main color.

This needs some supports, check example:

![alt text](images/print_bottom_support.png "print overview")


### AqMood-Top
When importing, choose "Yes" to "... single object having multiple parts?"

![alt text](images/print_small_shell_multi_parts.png "print overview")

Print in transparent color or 

if you have a multicolor printer, set the parts like this (yellow is main color, gray is transparent)

### AqMood-LedTower

Print in main color.

## Build Guide

### Prepare PCB 

Bend the 8pin pin header by 90 degrees, works very well on a solid ground.

![alt text](images/8pin_bend.png "print overview")

Solder all connectors and pin headers to the pcb like this:

![alt text](images/pcb_assembled.png "print overview")

The 8pin header for the LCD is soldered from the bottom, like shown in the image.

The qwiic connector is not needed! It is optional in case you have SMD solder equipment. 

### Prepare Leds

You need 1x7 Leds and 2x 3 leds, 13 in total, prepare them like this:

![alt text](images/leds.png "Leds ")

Make sure + and ground are correct!

The order of the LEDs is important to match the text on the top!

Start on the side with the nodge with the 7 leds going over the top and back into the bottom.

![alt text](images/leds_tower_1.png "Leds ")

Next is the left side, get both 3*Leds first to the top again and then below the LED strip back down on the other side.

![alt text](images/leds_tower_2.png "Leds ")

### Prepare the Touch Button

![alt text](images/button.png "Leds ")

Make sure + and ground are correct!

### Prepare SEN66

Prepare a cable with  GH1.25 male - 6pin on one side and JST-XH 2.5 male - 4pin on the other side like this:

![alt text](images/sen66_1.png "Leds ")

![alt text](images/sen66_2.png "Leds ")

### Connect and Test Hardware 

Connect everything and flash the firmware. I recommend testing everything before final assembly.

![alt text](images/test_assembly.png "Leds ")

Leds should work (might need to enable by long press the button) and LCD should show the UI.

Test cycle through the display modes. It might take up to 20 sec until all measurements are available.

### Final Assembly 

Remove supports from the 3D printed parts and add the heat insert. 


Insert the SEN66 sensor, and disconnect it from the PCB if you have tested it.


![alt text](images/build_sen66.png "Leds ")

Insert the heat insert now into the bottom part!

Insert the PCB with the LCD and connect everthing.

Use M3x5 screw to secure pcb.


![alt text](images/build_assembly.png "Leds ")

But the LED tower on and then the top part, DONE!

## Firmware

If you don't want to build and flash with esphome yourself, you can use one of the four pre-build firmwares:
* [firmware.c3.bin](esphome/bin/firmware.c3.bin)
* [firmware.c3.standalone.bin - no WIFI / Home Assistant](esphome/bin/firmware.c3.standalone.bin)
* [firmware.s3.bin](esphome/bin/firmware.s3.bin)
* [firmware.s3.standalone.bin - no WIFI / Home Assistant](esphome/bin/firmware.s3.standalone.bin)

Files with "standalone" inm the name are the versions without wifi/home assistant supptort
Make sure you flaash the correct version for your ESP!

### How to flash the firmware - easy mode

Use https://web.esphome.io/ to flash one of the 2 provided firmeware flavours:
* With wifi and home assistant firmware.c3.bin or firmware.s3.bin
* Standalone - firmware.c3.standalone.bin or firmware.s3.standalone.bin


Go to https://web.esphome.io/ 

connect your xiao-seed-esp32-s3 or c3 and 

hold reset and boot (both buttons), 

release reset first, this puts  the esp32 into flash mode.

Now hit connect and select the device

![alt text](images/fw_connect.png "connect")

You will see a screen like this, hit "Install"

![alt text](images/fw_install.png "install")

Select the firmware file and fit "upload", it will take 1-2 min to install

![alt text](images/fw_upload_running.png "BOM")

![alt text](images/fw_install_done.png "BOM")

The firmware is now flashed and aqMood should reboot and start working!


## WIFI Setup

If you  choose to use aqMood together with home assistant, you need to connect aqMood to your wifi now

First, connect to the AP that is created

AP: mista-aq-mood-c3 or mista-aq-mood-s3
PW: aqMoodaqMood

Then go to '192.168.4.1' in your browser of choice

![alt text](images/wifisetup_configure.png "wifi config")

and set your SSID and PW, done!

## Home assistant 

This shows all availiable values in home assistant provided by AqMood.

![alt text](images/home_assistant.png "home assistant")

### Passwords for home assistant api and OTA

#### Home assistant api password
aqmoodpw

#### Esphome OTA password
aqmoodpw

## Build with esphome

Current version was compiled with esphome 2025.2.2.

Run esphome run aq-mood-c3.yaml in the esphome folder to build and upload your version.

Passwords are stored in secrets.yaml, some stuff can be easily modified in the main file aq-mood-c3.yaml in the SUBSTITIONS section.

If you want to code a wifi pw hard, this is done in src/aq-mood-home-assistant.yaml

As of now, there is no official driver for the sen66 sensor in esphome, so I quickly adopted the sen5X driver and published it here: https://github.com/tuct/esphome_external_components

This will be updated to use the official driver as soon as it is released.
